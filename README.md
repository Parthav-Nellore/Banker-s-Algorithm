The Banker’s Algorithm is used in operating systems to avoid deadlock by managing resource allocation among processes. It ensures that a system can allocate resources to each process in a way that avoids deadlock, by simulating resource requests and determining if the system will remain in a safe state after granting the request.

This implementation simulates the Banker’s Algorithm by managing resources through the following matrices:

	•	Allocated Matrix: Tracks the resources currently allocated to each process.
	•	Maximum Matrix: Represents the maximum demand of each process.
	•	Need Matrix: Calculated as Need = Maximum - Allocated for each process.
	•	Available Matrix: Indicates the resources currently available in the system.

Features:

	1.	Input: The user provides the number of processes and resources, and fills in the Allocated, Maximum, and Available matrices.
	2.	Safe Sequence Check: The algorithm checks if there exists a sequence of processes (called a safe sequence) such that resources can be allocated in that order, guaranteeing that all processes can complete without causing a deadlock.
	3.	Output: The program prints a safe sequence if one exists, or informs the user if the system is in an unsafe state.

Steps:

	1.	Read Input: The program reads the number of processes and resources, followed by the Allocated, Maximum, and Available matrices.
	2.	Calculate Need: The Need matrix is calculated by subtracting the Allocated matrix from the Maximum matrix.
	3.	Check Safe Sequence: The algorithm then checks if a safe sequence exists by trying to allocate resources to processes in an order where no deadlock will occur.
	4.	Output Safe Sequence: If a safe sequence is found, it prints the sequence and declares the system in a safe state. Otherwise, it declares the system unsafe.

This implementation avoids built-in functions and provides a basic example of the Banker’s Algorithm logic.
